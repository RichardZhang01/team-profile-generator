## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to create an application that was well organized (in terms of file structure), properly validated (to the best of my ability), and using test driven development (TDD). 
- I built this project to further enhance my understanding of Node.js, Inquirer, and fs. I also wanted to use what I learned to be able to create a well organized application that uses the principles of TDD and object-oriented-programming (OOP).
- This project aims to generate an HTML page that displays basic information of members of a team, that has basic styling, and takes user-input using the command-line through Inquirer.
- Through this project, I learned how to better use classes and OOP, TDD, how to better organize my various files and folders, how to create tests (and how to use Jest), and JavaScript in general.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

**Note**: This application requires the use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To install this project, all you need to do is clone this repo. To install dependencies, open in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and in the terminal run: 

      npm install 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the application's installation location in [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or similar command-line tool) and do the same.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Once the application is opened in Visual Studio Code, or navigated to using Git Bash (or similar command-line tool), run: 

      node index.js 

Answer the questions, and once you're done, an HTML file will be generated in the **dist** folder with basic styling included using [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) (CDN linked in the HTML document) and some custom CSS (based on the style.css also in the dist folder).
